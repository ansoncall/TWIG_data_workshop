# TWIG Data Worshop
This is the source code for the TWIG Data Workshop exercise. 

The TWIG (Treatment and Wildfire Interagency Geodatabase) is a spatial database of forest management activities relating to wildfire and fuel reduction. It is the most comprehensive nationwide database of fuel treatments on federal lands. With the upcoming addition state agency and NGO data from the [National Fuels Treatment initiative](https://nft.garphub.org/), it will be the most comprehensive nationwide database of fuel treatments across all lands. 

The TWIG data workshop is designed to introduce users to TWIG and the ReSHAPE project, build familiarity and confidence in working with TWIG data, and prepare participants to use TWIG data in their own projects. In the workshop exercise, users will have the chance to:
- download and examine TWIG data up-close
- identify and avoid common pitfall when working with fuel treatment data
- combine TWIG data with an external data source ```TODO: fill this in with a specific source``` to answer a simple research question

This exercise is designed for participants who already have some experience using R. 

This repository contains two scripts:
- ```analysis.R```: This is the script you should begin working with. You will write your code here. It already contains some comments to help guide your coding throughout the exercise.  
- ```analysis_complete.R```: This is a "cheat sheet." It has the same structure as analysis.R, but with all of the code already written. You can use this if you get stuck or prefer to follow along, rather than writing it out yourself.
